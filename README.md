# Notes

[Demo](https://notes-client-tau.vercel.app/)

A full-stack note-taking application that is built on React.js and Node.js. 

I built this application because I wanted to strengthen my full-stack development skills. It has been 3 months since I last
built a MERN-stack application. I wanted to try my hand at something similar to my previous full stack app, which is a todo list,
but this time I wanted to implement the SOLID design principles as well as use the right tools for data fetching. 

I'm developing this application the same time that I'm building a Next.js blog website. I wanted to experience working on multiple 
projects at one and switching back and forth between these projects.

## Tools
Front-end: React.js, TailwindCSS, React Query, React Router DOM, React Hot Toast

Back-end: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, Passport.js
